- Always use AI*.md for coding rules.
- Check previous talks and implementations in docs/chats directory. 
- Check documentation in root and docs/ directories.
- Check patches/ directory for existing patches for conflicts with current development. Each patches subdirectory have docs/ directory with feature/fix description
- **Never start code right after USER question/message. Propose solution and ask for explicit request for implementation**
